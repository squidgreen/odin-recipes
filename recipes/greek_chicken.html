            <li>2 cups halved cherry tomatoes</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Combine chicken thighs, 2 teaspoons kosher salt, pepper, rosemary,
            thyme, oregano, red pepper flakes, cayenne, garlic, lemon juice,
            and 1/4 cup olive oil in a large mixing bowl. Toss very thoroughly
            to combine, making sure the chicken thighs are completely and
            evenly coated with the marinade.
        </li>
        <li>Wrap in plastic and marinate in the fridge for 6 to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>
            Preheat the oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Line a baking
            sheet with foil and grease generously with olive oil.
        </li>
        <li>
            Meanwhile, halve potatoes lengthwise; slice each half into
            3 equal pieces. Dice into cubes and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer chicken thighs to the prepared sheet pan smooth-side up,
            spacing evenly. Reserve any excess marinade in the bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the potatoes to the bowl the chicken was in, along with a
            splash of olive oil and a large pinch of salt. Toss well to coat
            evenly. Scatter potatoes onto the chicken and distribute as evenly
            as possible in between the chicken thighs to fill any empty spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Roast in the center of the preheated oven until the chicken is
            cooked through, about 35 minutes. Remove chicken to a plate or dish
            and cover. Chicken can be cut into bite-sized pieces if desired.
        </li>
        <li>
            While chicken and potatoes are cooking, whisk red wine vinegar,
            olive oil, lemon juice, salt, and pepper together for dressing.
            Taste and adjust vinegar or oil as needed. Whisk in parsley and
            oregano.
        </li>
        <li>
            Toss the potatoes in the chicken fat and pan drippings, and return
            to the oven until well browned and crusty, 10 to 15 minutes. Let
            potatoes rest for a few minutes before removing them with a spatula.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make bowls, toss together cucumbers, tomatoes, red onions, feta
            cheese, chicken, potatoes, and dressing until evenly combined.
            Serve on top of a bowl of greens.
        </li>
    </ol>
